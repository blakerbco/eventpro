# Auction Intel Refund Policy

**Effective Date:** 02/25/2026
**Last Updated:** 02/25/2025

This Refund Policy explains how refunds and wallet credits work for Auction Intel.

## 1. Wallet Credits Are Non-Refundable

All funds added to your Auction Intel wallet are **non-refundable**, except where required by applicable law.

This includes wallet top-ups used for:

* nonprofit research fees,
* lead fees,
* and other in-platform charges.

## 2. No Expiration of Wallet Credits

Wallet credits do **not** expire unless otherwise stated in writing by Auction Intel.

## 3. Research Fees Are Charged for Work Performed

Research fees are charged per nonprofit researched, whether or not a qualifying event lead is found. This is because Auction Intel performs compute- and web-research work for each nonprofit processed.

## 4. Lead Charges and Billability Rules

Lead charges are applied according to the tier(s) selected and the platform’s billability rules shown in the product at the time of the search.

Where the product states a verified event page link is required for a billable lead, leads without a qualifying verified event page link are not charged as billable leads.

## 5. Mistaken Charges / Billing Errors

If you believe you were charged in error (for example, duplicate charging, technical malfunction, or a billing bug), contact support within **14 days** of the charge and include:

* your account email,
* date/time of charge,
* amount charged,
* search/job ID (if available),
* and a brief description of the issue.

We will review the request in good faith. If we confirm a billing error, we may issue a correction, wallet credit adjustment, or refund at our discretion (or as required by law).

## 6. Promotional Credits and Free Trial Credits

Promotional credits, trial credits, and bonus credits:

* are not redeemable for cash,
* are non-transferable,
* may expire if stated in the promotion terms,
* and may be revoked if issued in error or used in violation of the Terms.

## 7. Chargebacks

Before initiating a chargeback, please contact us so we can review and attempt to resolve the issue quickly. Fraudulent or abusive chargebacks may result in account suspension or termination.
