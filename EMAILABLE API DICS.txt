Authentication
Introduction
# Using api_key parameter
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/api_endpoint?api_key=your_api_key"

# Using Authorization header
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/api_endpoint" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
Make sure to replace your_api_key with your API key.

Emailable uses API keys to allow access to our API. To get started, sign up for an account here.

Emailable expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server as a URL parameter, or as POST data for POST endpoints.

Alternatively, you can use an HTTP Authorization header with your API key. In the header, specify the Bearer scheme followed by your API key. (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key").

 You must replace your_api_key with your API key.
Security
Emailable has two types of API Keys. Please use the proper API key for your application.

Private API Keys
This type of key is meant to be used on the server-side of your application. These keys should never be exposed because they are not protected.

Should a Private API key be compromised, you should immediately generate a new one by using the "roll key" function in the dashboard.

To enhance security, you can specify a list of trusted IP addresses for each Private API key. If specified, only requests originating from one of the IP addresses you have listed will be accepted.

Private API keys can be used to access any API endpoint.

Public API Keys
This type of key is meant to be used anywhere that the key will be exposed publicly. One example would be using the API in the JavaScript of a website to verify that user entered email addresses are valid.

To prevent abuse of your account, we require that you set up a list of trusted domains when you create a Public API key. All requests that are made using a Public API key will only work if they originate from a trusted domain. They will also be rate limited to 10 unique requests per day per user.

If you've configured a captcha provider for your API key, you will need to send a captcha_response parameter with the request. This will be used to validate the captcha with your captcha provider. If the captcha fails to verify, the API will return a 403 status code.

Public API keys are limited to authenticating requests to the /verify endpoint. Attempting to use a Public API key for any other endpoint will fail.

Testing
For either type of API key (Public or Private), a test key can be used instead of a live key. When creating an API key, you will be asked whether you want to create a test key or a live key. If you choose to create a test key, the key you generate will begin with "test_" instead of "live_".

Any requests made with a test key will not use credits or perform real verifications. Instead, a simulated response will be returned. This is useful for testing whether your application is correctly making API calls without having to waste credits.

You can also use a test key with certain test email addresses to generate responses with specific attributes. This is documented below.

Batches created with a test key will be automatically deleted after 24 hours.

Trusted IP address and trusted domain restrictions will still apply to test keys. Domain-based rate limits for Public API keys are not enforced for test keys.

Client Libraries
Below is a list of client libraries.

Ruby
emailable-ruby
Node JS
emailable-node
Python
emailable-python
OAuth Apps
# Using access_token parameter
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/api_endpoint?access_token=your_access_token"

# Using Authorization header
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/api_endpoint" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
Make sure to replace your_access_token with the access token.

If you've authenticated a user with an OAuth App, you should have an access token for that user. You can use the access token to authenticate to the Emailable API by sending an access_token parameter instead of an api_key parameter. Alternatively, you can use an HTTP Authorization header with the access token. In the header, specify the Bearer scheme followed by the access token. (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token").

See OAuth for more information on OAuth endpoints, including instructions for obtaining an access token.

Emails
Verify an email
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/verify?email=john@smith.com&api_key=your_api_key"
The above command returns JSON structured like this:

{
  "accept_all": null,
  "did_you_mean": null,
  "disposable": false,
  "domain": "gmail.com",
  "duration": 0.493,
  "email": "john.smith@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "free": true,
  "full_name": "John Smith",
  "gender": "male",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "mailbox_full": false,
  "mx_record": "aspmx.l.google.com",
  "no_reply": false,
  "reason": "accepted_email",
  "role": false,
  "score": 100,
  "smtp_provider": "google",
  "state": "deliverable",
  "tag": null,
  "user": "john.smith"
}
If a verification is taking too long, a 249 status code will be returned:

{
  "message": "Your request is taking longer than normal. Please send your request again."
}
Verify a single email. If a verification request takes longer than the timeout, you may retry this request for up to 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, further requests will count against your usage. The verification result will be returned when it is available.

When a test key is used, a random sample response will be returned.

HTTP Request
GET https://api.emailable.com/v1/verify

Parameters
Parameter	Required	Description
email	true	The email you want verified.
smtp	false	true or false. The SMTP step takes up the majority of the API's response time. If you would like to speed up your response times, you can disable this step. However, this will significantly decrease verification accuracy. Default: true
accept_all	false	true or false. Whether or not an accept-all check is performed. Heavily impacts API's response time. Default: false
api_key	false	Your API key.
access_token	false	Your access token.

Verify a batch of emails
curl -X POST "https://api.emailable.com/v1/batch" \
-d "emails=tim@smith.com,john@smith.com" \
-d "url=http://example.com/callback" \
-d "api_key=your_api_key"
The above command returns JSON structured like this:

{
  "message": "Batch successfully created.",
  "id": "5cf6dd30093f96d2ac34bb0a"
}
Verify a batch of emails. The emails should be sent as a parameter emails and should be separated by commas. Up to 50,000 emails can be sent per batch. For enterprise accounts, larger batches may be requested by contacting support.

Data can be encoded as application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or application/json.

Please ensure that all parameters are sent in the HTTP request body, not in the query string portion of the URL.

If a URL is specified, the results will be sent to it via HTTP POST upon batch completion. The body will be JSON data, identical to the output from the batch status (GET /v1/batch) endpoint below. The endpoint should return an HTTP 200 status. If any other status code is returned, the results will continue to be sent hourly until a 200 status code is returned, or until 3 days have passed since the batch finished verifying.

When a test key is used, a successful batch creation response will be returned along with an example batch id. Additionally, it is possible to simulate certain API responses when using a test key by utilizing the simulate parameter.

Batches created with a test key will be automatically deleted after 24 hours.

HTTP Request
POST https://api.emailable.com/v1/batch

Parameters
Parameter	Required	Description
emails	true	A comma separated list of emails.
url	false	A URL that will receive the batch results via HTTP POST.
api_key	false	Your API key.
access_token	false	Your access token.
response_fields	false	A comma separated list of fields to include in the response. If nothing is specified, all fields will be returned. Valid fields are accept_all, did_you_mean, disposable, domain, email, first_name, free, full_name, gender, last_name, mailbox_full, mx_record, no_reply, reason, role, score, smtp_provider, state, tag, and user.
retries	false	Defaults to true. Retries increase accuracy by automatically retrying verification when our system receives certain responses from mail servers. To speed up verification, you can disable this by setting retries to false; however, doing so may increase the number of unknown responses.
simulate	false	Used to simulate certain responses from the API while using a test key. Valid options are generic_error, insufficient_credits_error, payment_error, and card_error.
Response
Attribute	Type	Description
message	String	A message about your batch.
id	String	The unique ID of the batch.
Get the status of a batch
curl "https://api.emailable.com/v1/batch?api_key=your_api_key&id=5cf6dd30093f96d2ac34bb0a"
If your batch is incomplete, a message will be returned, as well as the batch's progress if it is processing:

GET requests to the batch endpoint will get the current status of the batch verification job specified in the id parameter.

When a credit card transaction is necessary to obtain enough credits to verify a batch, billing related messages will be returned if there is an error. These will be sent with a 402 response code.

When a test key is used, a random sample response will be returned for each email in the batch. Additionally, it is possible to simulate certain API responses when using a test key by utilizing the simulate parameter.

HTTP Request
GET https://api.emailable.com/v1/batch

Parameters
Parameter	Required	Description
id	true	The id of the batch.
api_key	false	Your API key.
access_token	false	Your access token.
partial	false	A boolean value indicating whether to include partial results when a batch is still verifying. This option is only available for batches with up to 1,000 emails. Defaults to false.
simulate	false	Used to simulate certain responses from the API while using a test key. Valid options are generic_error, importing, verifying, and paused.
Response
By default, all fields will be returned for each email in the response. It is possible to limit the fields that are returned by specifying the response_fields parameter on batch creation. See the batch creation parameters for details.

Depending on the size of your batch, the batch status endpoint will operate in one of two ways.

Up to 1,000 emails
The response will include an emails key that will be an array containing responses for each email in the batch.

After 30 days, the response will no longer return the emails key and their individual verification results. Only the aggregate counts for the batch will be returned.

Over 1,000 emails
The response will include a download_file key. This will be a URL to a ZIP compressed CSV file that contains all of the responses for each email in the batch.

After 5 days, the response will no longer return the download_file key. Only the aggregate counts for the batch will be returned.

Attribute	Type	Description
message	String	A message about your batch.
processed	Integer	The number of emails that have been verified in the batch.
total	Integer	The total number of emails in your batch.
emails	Array	An array containing responses for each email in the batch. This field will only be returned for batches up to 1,000 emails. (See single email verification for more information on the response fields.)
download_file	String	A URL for a ZIP compressed CSV file containing responses for each email in the batch. This field will only be returned for batches over 1,000 emails.
id	String	The unique ID of the batch.
reason_counts	Hash	A hash with one key per possible reason attribute. The values are integers representing the number of emails with that reason.
total_counts	Hash	A hash with one key per possible state attribute. The values are integers representing the number of emails with that state. In addition to the state keys, total_counts also contains keys processed and total, with values indicating the number of emails in the batch.
Test email addresses
There are several email addresses that can be used to return specific attributes when using a test API key. These will only work with the verify endpoint, not the batch endpoint.

Email	Response
deliverable@example.com	state will be deliverable
undeliverable@example.com	state will be undeliverable
risky@example.com	state will be risky
unknown@example.com	state will be unknown
role@example.com	role will be true
free@example.com	free will be true
accept-all@example.com	accept_all will be true
disposable@example.com	disposable will be true
slow@example.com	returns a 249 status code

Widget
Using our widget is the easiest way to get email verification integrated into your existing website. Just install our embed code and we'll do the rest.

Install the embed code
Click here to go to the API page. Click "New Key" and create a Public API key. After you select Public, you will see an input for Trusted Domains. Be sure to enter the domain(s) that you will be installing the embed code on.

For the security of your account, Public API Keys are restricted to 10 unique verifications per day per IP Address. All requests sent after the limit is reached will fail with a 429 status code response. If you need to do more extensive testing please make sure you use a Test Key which does not have this limit.

Once you have an API key, install the code and we'll begin verifying any input with the type email.

 You must replace your_api_key with your API key.

    message: 'Rate limit reached'
  }
  */
});
</script>
OAuth
These endpoints are used to authenticate to OAuth Apps you've created in Emailable. OAuth apps allow you to authenticate your users with Emailable and make API requests on their behalf.

Emailable implements the OAuth 2 Authorization Code flow.

Errors are handled as specified by the OAuth 2 spec.

Authorize
To initiate the OAuth flow, your application should link to the authorize endpoint with the necessary parameters.

If any parameters are incorrect or if a required parameter is missing, the rendered page will not prompt the user to authorize. Instead, it will display an error page containing an error description.

HTTP Request
GET https://api.emailable.com/oauth/authorize

Parameters
Parameter	Required	Description
response_type	true	The string code
client_id	true	Your OAuth App's client ID
redirect_uri	true	Your OAuth App's redirect URI
state	false	An arbitrary string included in the request that the server returns unchanged, allowing the client to verify the response and prevent CSRF.
Response
If the request succeeds, the user will be redirected to your redirect URI with an authorization code. You will also receive a state string if you provided one. The authorization code expires 10 minutes after it is issued.

Attribute	Description
code	The authorization code generated by the server.
state	The state string, if one was provided in the request.
Access Token
curl -X POST "https://api.emailable.com/oauth/token" \
-d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
-d "code=example-code" \
-d "client_id=example-client-id" \
-d "client_secret=example-client-secret" \
